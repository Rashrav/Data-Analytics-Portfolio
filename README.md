# Data Analytics Portfolio

Author - Rashrav Shrestha

The Repository contains Portfolio of Data Analytics Projects completed by me for academic, self learning and hobby purposes. The prejects are presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, and R markdown file.


## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
- Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
- Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

## Contents

### 1. Machine Learning Projects
- [Data Exploration of the Movie Lens Dataset](https://github.com/Rashrav/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Move%20Lens%20Data%20Exploration.ipynb): Simple procedures such as removing missing values and outliers, displaying descriptive statistics were carried out. Upon exploring and preparing the data, appropriate plots were created to explore the correlation between different features and the rating score.

- [Linear Regression Model: Predictive Analytics](https://github.com/Rashrav/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Linear%20Regression-Predictive%20Analysis.ipynb): The primary focus of this task was training the linear regression models to predict user ratings towards movies. Included basic data science workflow which involved the process of exploring the data, building models, making predictions and evaluating results. The impacts of feature selection of the model were also explored. Experimentation with different training and testing sizes was also carried out. Finally, the models were evaluated and their accuracy on the testing data was visualized and proper conclusions were made.


- [Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors: Predictive Analytics](https://github.com/Rashrav/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Logistic%20Regression%20and%20KNN.ipynb): In this task, a Simple Logistic regression model, as well as the more advanced K-Nearest Neighbors trained in order to build and evaluate a predictive model for the feedback variable in the MovieLens Dataset. 


- [Supervised Learning: Exploratory Analysis of the Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/Rashrav/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Titanic%20Data-Supervised%20Learning.ipynb): The titanic dataset which was obtained from Kaggle was used for this portfolio task. The high-level goal of the project was divided into four different parts: Data Analysis and Prediction was conducted on the Titanic Dataset which involved the typical Data Science workflow of Data Exploration, Data preparation, Data modelling and Evaluation. Various Machine learning models such as Random Forst, Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes were trained in order to predict the survivability of the passenger based on available features. The performance and accuracy of different machine learning models were compared with each other and the model with the best accuracy in predicting the survivability was identified.

### 2. Data Analysis and Visualization
- [Exploratory Data Analysis Using R](https://github.com/Rashrav/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Visualization/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20Using%20R.pdf): Applied appropriate statistical methods, such as one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA and multiple regression, to answer research questions. Justified and evaluated assumptions underlying the models, and modified the analysis if needed. Used R-studio to create model output and interpreted them. Full r codes presented [here](https://github.com/Rashrav/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Visualization/R%20Script.Rmd).
